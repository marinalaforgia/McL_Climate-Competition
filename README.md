# McL_Climate-Competition

This is the repository for chapter 2 of my dissertation investigating the interactive effects of precipitation variability and competition from invasive annual grasses on native annual forbs that vary in drought tolerance. The project manuscript titled "Invasive species synergize with climatic variability to reduce success of natives", can be found in the manuscript folder (most recent version: "20190910-LaForgia.docx"). Coauthors include Dr. Andrew Latimer and Dr. Susan Harrison. 

The project seeks to answer how competition with invaders alters the ability of native forbs with variable drought response strategies to cope with a variable climate, namely drought or increased rainfall. 

## Analyses

The script used to generate the project's analysis is titled "20190606_Categorical-Analysis" and found in the "Scripts" folder. To run this script, the following post-processing data files are needed:

* __grass-cover.csv__: data on grass cover per subplot; not ultimately used
* __Marina-Treatment-30.csv__: experimental design
* __dem-data-16.csv__: census data from 2016
* __dem-data-17.csv__: census data from 2017
* __final-flo-seed.csv__: seed set and flowering data, both years
* __seed-carryover-plot.csv__: seed bag data, both years
* __final-traits-w.csv__: trait data
* __final-sla-13c.csv__: trait data, includes more species; not ultimately used
